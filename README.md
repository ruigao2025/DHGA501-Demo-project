Demo project（Whampoa Military Academy）
This assignment analyzes the geographical origins of cadets in the Fifth Battalion of the first graduating class of the Whampoa Military Academy. The original name list was obtained from the 黄埔军校同学会（Alumni Association of the Whampoa Military Academy） . After manually extracting the names and native places of the Fifth Battalion cadets, AI tools such as ChatGPT were used to convert the unstructured PDF text into structured data, producing an initial CSV table.<br>
Due to historical transcription errors or variations in place names in the original records (e.g., "未阳" should be "耒阳", "醚陵" refers to "醴陵"), a systematic process of place-name verification and standardization was conducted during data cleaning. To accurately quantify geographical distribution, the native place information was split into two fields, province and county, resulting in a cleaned CSV dataset. For intuitive visualization of this spatial pattern, the CSV data was converted into an interactive HTML map. The map uses color saturation and area size to represent the density of cadet origins, while hovering allows users to view the specific number and percentage of cadets from each province.<br>
The analysis reveals that although the Whampoa Military Academy was institutionally committed to the ideal of "breaking localism" and building a national army, the geographical distribution of its first cohort shows a highly concentrated pattern. Hunan(湖南) province alone contributed over half (58.6%) of the cadets. Combined with Jiangxi (江西) province (20.7%), these two provinces accounted for nearly 80% of the total. This high concentration clearly reflects the Academy's heavy reliance, during its early stage, on pre-existing regional revolutionary networks for recruitment.<br>
(Note: Due to differences between the 1925 administrative divisions and contemporary Chinese province and county boundaries, and given limitations in historical geographical data completeness, this analysis uses current administrative maps as the baseline for visualization.)<br>
